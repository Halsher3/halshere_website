            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="sub-title">
                I am a 23 year old man with a computer and creative mind. I am
                fairly easy going and get along with everyone I encounter. I am a
                Nigerian and Kenyan man with a computer and love for cars. I enjoy 
                coding along with graphic design as shown with my own logo made by me
                on this page. I hope to use this as my showing to people off who I am and what
                I enjoy!

            <h2>Who is Halshere?</h2>
            <p class="sub-title">
                Halshere is a name I use for most things that are recreational in my life.
                Like social media and the video games I play. My username will almost always
                be Halshere!
            </p>
            <!--INSERT A PICTURE TO REP HALSHERE HERE??-->
            <h2>Does the name Halshere mean anything?</h2>
            <p class="sub-title">
                I made the name when i was 8 years old. I took the "Hal" part of the name
                from Battleship Halberd from the Kirby games. Then I told myself "My name NEEDS
                to have an S in it because Sonic the Hedgehog has an S in his name AND THATS COOL". So
                "shere" came to my mind after think about it for a while. The name Halshere was born.
            </p>

            <h3>BONUS STORY</h3>
            <p>The pronunciation of my name is suppose to be "Hal-shere" it was until i went to my first 
                smash brothers tourney ever at 14 and the TO said my name as "Hals here" and my life took a 180 after that </p>
